# Smart Contracts for Blockchain Developers

[![Support Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support-Project-critical)](https://github.com/harendra-shakya/support/blob/main/README.md) 

This repository comprises smart contracts every developer should master building, covering essential skills from token creation to decentralized governance.

1. **Token Contracts:** Create standard ERC-20 or ERC-721 token contracts. ERC-20 tokens are fungible (interchangeable) tokens, while ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible (unique) tokens. Understanding how to create and manage tokens is fundamental to many blockchain projects.

1. **Crowdsale (ICO) Contracts:** Develop contracts that enable fundraising by allowing users to exchange ETH or other cryptocurrencies for your project's tokens. Implementing security measures and handling contributions correctly is essential for ICO success.

1. **Multi-Signature Wallets:** Construct a multi-signature wallet contract that requires multiple parties to sign off on transactions before they are executed. This adds an extra layer of security, especially for projects with large funds.

1. **Staking/Time-Locked Contracts:** Develop staking contracts that allow token holders to lock up their tokens and receive rewards for locking their tokens for a specific time.

1. **Oracle Contracts:** Implement oracle contracts that fetch real-world data and feed it into the blockchain. Oracles are critical for smart contracts that rely on external information.

1. **Auction Contracts:** Create smart contracts that enable auctions for digital assets or unique items. Users can bid on items directly through the blockchain.

1. **Governance Contracts:** Design contracts that facilitate decentralized governance, allowing token holders to vote on proposals and make decisions regarding the project's future.

1. **Subscription Contracts:** Develop subscription-based smart contracts that automatically charge users at regular intervals in exchange for access to specific services or content.

1. **Lottery Contracts:** Build transparent and fair lottery contract using chainlink vrf that randomly select winners and distribute prizes automatically.

1. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):** Create contracts that power DAOs, enabling decentralized decision-making and organization management.

1. **Lending and Borrowing Contracts:** Contracts that facilitate peer-to-peer lending and borrowing of digital assets, enabling interest earnings and collateral-backed loans.

1. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEX):** Create a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens directly from their wallets without the need for a central authority. DEXs are an essential part of the DeFi ecosystem.

These projects cover a wide range of use cases and will give you valuable experience in different aspects of blockchain development. As you build these contracts, remember to consider security best practices and conduct thorough testing before deploying them on the mainnet. Also, keep up to date with the latest advancements and updates in the blockchain ecosystem, as the technology is continually evolving.
